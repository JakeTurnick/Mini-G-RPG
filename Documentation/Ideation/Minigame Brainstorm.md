# Minigame ideas for Mini-G RPG

### Self contained games played during an endcounter
### - Room to include stats to affect player controlling
### - Room for 'Leveled up' versions of games

- How can each of these be scored to affect rewards?
	Ex: Galag - EnemiesKilled / EnemiesMissed = reward potential
	- Do I show how it's scored? Maybe just key the player into tracked values ?
